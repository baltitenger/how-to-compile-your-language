                <h1>How to compile your language</h1>

                <p>
                    This guide is intended to be an introduction to how to
                    design <i>your language</i> and implement a compiler for it
                    using a modern approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When designing a language it helps if there is an idea what
                    the language is going to be used for. Is it indented to be
                    making system programming safer like Rust? Is it targeting
                    AI developers like Mojo?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case the goal of the language is to showcase various
                    algorithms and techniques that are seen in some of the most
                    popular language implementations like C++, Kotlin or Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The guide also covers how to create a platform specific
                    executable with the help of the LLVM compiler
                    infrastructure, which all of the previously mentioned
                    languages use for the same purpose. Yes, even Kotlin can be
                    compiled to a native executable with the introduction of
                    Kotlin/Native.
                </p>
                <h2>What does every language have in common?</h2>
                <p>
                    When creating a new language, the first question is how to
                    get started. There is something that every existing language
                    and <i>your language</i> must define too, which is the entry
                    point from which the execution starts.
                </p>
                <pre><code>fn main(): void {}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    When designing the syntax of the
                    <code>main()</code> function one of the key goals was to
                    make it easily recognizable to developers with a background
                    in any popular language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past 50 years the syntax of a function declaration
                    was the name of the function followed by the list of
                    arguments enclosed by <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>. At
                    first glance it is tempting to introduce some new exotic
                    syntax like <code>main<> {}</code>, but in many of the
                    popular languages <code><</code> and <code>></code> mean
                    something completely different (a generic argument list).
                    Using the latter syntax for a function definition would
                    probably cause confusion for developers who try to get
                    familiar with this new language.
                </p>
                <h2>How is this text turned into an executable?</h2>
                <p>
                    Indeed, so far the <code>main()</code> function is just a
                    few words of text stored in a file. A compiler usually
                    consists of 3 major pieces. A <code>frontend</code>, an
                    <code>optimizer</code> and a <code>backend</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>frontend</code> contains the actual implementation
                    of the language, it is responsible for ensuring that the
                    program written in the specific language doesn't contain any
                    errors and report every issue it finds to the developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once it validated the program, it turns it into an
                    <code>intermediate representation (IR)</code>, on which the
                    <code>optimizer</code> performs a series of transformations
                    that will result in a more efficient program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the program has been optimized, it is passed to the
                    <code>backend</code>, which will turn it into a series of
                    instructions, which can be executed by a specific target.
                    The steps the <code>backend</code> performs can vary based
                    on the target. Register-based targets like <code>x86</code>,
                    <code>ARM</code> or <code>RISC-V</code> assembly require
                    different steps than stack-based targets like
                    <code>WebAssembly</code> or <code>JVM Bytecode</code>.
                </p>
                <h2>Is it possible to learn all these topics?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, with enough time. However there is no need to learn all
                    of them to create a successful language. In fact even many
                    modern popular languages like
                    <code>Rust</code>, <code>Swift</code>,
                    <code>Haskell</code> and <code>Kotlin/Native</code> rely on
                    <code>LLVM</code> for optimization and code generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This guide also uses <code>LLVM</code> to create an
                    executable and focuses on implementing the frontend, which
                    consists of 3 parts, the <code>lexer</code>, the
                    <code>parser</code> and the <code>semantic analyzer</code>.
